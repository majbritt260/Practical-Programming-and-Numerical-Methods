PART A: Embedded rule Runge-Kutta ODE integrator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The driver and stepper routines are located in ODE.cs, where the embedded
stepper method is of order 12

For debugging purposes the routines were tested solving the second
order differential equation u''=-u which should return sin(x). This
is vizualised in odesolver_test.svg

With the driver and stepper routines the oscillator with friction example is
 reproduced, and vizualized in damped_oscillator.svg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART B: Alternative interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ODE interpolator is tested using the same ODE as in part A. This 
is vizualised in ode_interpolant_test.svg

Integrating the ODE for equatorial motion with the values for Îµ and initial 
conditions as stated in the homework description yields newtonian circular 
motion, newtonial elliptical motion, and the relativistic precession of a 
planetary orbit, respectively. These results are vizualised and can be seen 
in planetary_motion.svg
