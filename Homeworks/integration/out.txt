PART A: Recursive adaptive integrator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The integrator is tested using a selection of integrals with an accuracy goal of 1E-06:

Integral of Sqrt(x)       from x = 0 to x = 1.
Expectation: 0,666667
Result:      0,666667
Within accuracy goal: yes

Integral of 1/Sqrt(x)     from x = 0 to x = 1.
Expectation: 2
Result:      2,000000
Within accuracy goal: yes

Integral of 4*Sqrt(1-x^2) from x = 0 to x = 1.
Expectation: 3,141593
Result:      3,141593
Within accuracy goal: yes

Integral of ln(x)/Sqrt(x) from x = 0 to x = 1.
Expectation: -4
Result:      -4,000000
Within accuracy goal: yes

A comparison between the error function via its integral representation is illustrated in erfcomparison_tabdata.svg.
Furthermore a comparison of the accuracy between the erf from the plots exercise and the integral representation was made.
For del = eps = 1E-06, the erf from the plot excercise had a better approximation 9 times, while the integral
representation had a better approximation 23 times. This is illustrated in erfcomparison_plotsexercise.svg.
